Maybe some day I'd like to build a product hardware/software inspired by remotemouse. Currently I have a projector in my living room and a 50 ft hdmi cable running from my pc out to the projector. When I want to watch a movie I use the remotemouse app on my phone to control my mouse (phone is a trackpad for desktop now) and bring up a browser with my favorite service. I think this can be applied anywhere though - people could have screens in their bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms, and other rooms hooked up to the main house desktop (likely hosted in a main office). The desktop would run a host program so the desktop could be used while any of the other screens are interacted with (they have their own mouse, limited hardware resources, etc). Kitchen screen could do things like bring up cooking videos or simply something to watch while cooking - could be the news or youtube or netflix. Bedroom screen could act as tv, alarm clock, weather panel, message checker, chatgpt+google-home-style interactive screen. Living room would be living room of course. No additional logins necessary for living roomm tv and desktop, presets for each room can be configured on home app in desktop (paired with phone app perhaps for easier customization). Perhaps the phone app could allow you to throw something up on whatever screen you're nearest from your phone.
