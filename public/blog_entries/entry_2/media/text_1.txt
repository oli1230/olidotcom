Today my buddy Paddy was trying to explain the feeling of Nirvana, and he was describing how we are all connected and he says that perhaps we gain this perspective from an emotional, personal standpoint in Nirvana. But the way he described it, which I thought was really beautiful, was "we are like a tree, a web of connection - but we're not the nodes, we're the lines in between"
